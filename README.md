# PID Controller Simulation with Disturbance Handling

This repository contains a LabVIEW-based simulation of a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller designed for process control applications. The project demonstrates the implementation of a PID control system, disturbance handling with noise filtering, and the exploration of auto-tuning concepts.

## Project Overview

Objective:Develop a PID controller simulation that handles disturbances such as DC noise and low-frequency periodic noise, ensuring the process variable stabilizes near the setpoint.  
Features:
  - Simulation of process dynamics with real-world disturbances.
  - Implementation of noise filtering to enhance system stability.
  - Exploration of auto-tuning techniques for PID parameters.
Outcome: The process variable demonstrated stable
