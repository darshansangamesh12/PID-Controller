# PID Controller Simulation with Disturbance Handling

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) Controller in LabVIEW 2021. It focuses on stabilizing a simulated process variable (PV) to a desired setpoint (SP) under the influence of disturbances such as DC noise and low-frequency periodic noise.

## Key Features
- **PID Control Implementation**: Developed a fully functional PID controller to regulate the process variable.
- **Disturbance Handling**: Simulated real-world disturbances (DC and periodic noise) to test the robustness of the control system.
- **Graphical Visualization**: Plotted the process variable against time for better understanding and analysis.
- **Filter Integration**: Included noise filtering for improved controller performance.

## Highlights
- **Real-Life Simulation**: Replicated scenarios commonly encountered in industrial control systems, including noise and environmental variations.
- **Graphical Programming**: Designed entirely using LabVIEW 2021's graphical environment for intuitive flow and clarity.
- **Learning Objective**: Combined theoretical PID concepts with practical application, enhancing understanding of tuning and control strategies.

## How to Use
1. Open the LabVIEW 2021 `.vi` file provided in the repository.
2. Run the simulation and observe the performance of the PID controller.
3. Modify PID parameters or introduce new disturbances to explore further.


## Future Scope
- Fine-tune the auto-tuning algorithm for wider applications.
- Integrate advanced noise filters for better noise rejection.
- Expand the project to include hardware implementation.
